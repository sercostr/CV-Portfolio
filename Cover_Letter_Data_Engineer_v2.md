# Cover Letter - Senior Data Engineer Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Data Engineer position. With 6+ years of experience architecting enterprise-scale data platforms at Pharmaceutical Digital Manufacturing, I have a proven track record of building robust, scalable data infrastructure that enables business-critical decision making. I am excited to bring my expertise in real-time data pipelines, graph databases, and cloud-native architectures to your team.

## Building Enterprise Data Platforms at Scale

At Pharmaceutical, I have designed and implemented data systems processing 500K+ daily transactions across pharmaceutical manufacturing operations:

**Real-Time Data Platform**: I architected a real-time data refresh system integrating 8 source systems (SAP, LIMS, Snowflake, Oracle, SQL Server) into a unified PostgreSQL data warehouse. This platform reduced data latency from 24 hours to <5 minutes, enabling near-real-time manufacturing visibility for 200+ stakeholders. The system processes 100K+ records daily with automated error handling, concurrency control, and comprehensive monitoring.

**Enterprise Knowledge Graph**: I built Pharmaceutical's first pharmaceutical manufacturing knowledge graph on Neo4j, managing 1M+ nodes and 5M+ relationships. This involved developing 50+ Airflow DAGs orchestrating complex ETL workflows, creating graph transformation pipelines using Cypher, and implementing data lineage tracking across 100+ tables. The platform enables semantic queries and graph-based analytics impossible with traditional relational databases.

**Data Quality Excellence**: I developed automated data quality frameworks with 25+ validation checks across critical datasets, reducing data issues by 40% and achieving 99.5% data quality scores. My alert system provides real-time HTML-formatted monitoring reports and immediate error notifications, improving issue detection time by 3 hours.

## Technical Excellence & Best Practices

My approach to data engineering emphasizes reliability, performance, and maintainability:

**Cloud-Native Architecture**: I led the migration from on-premises infrastructure to AWS cloud, reducing operational costs by 30%. I containerized 20+ data applications using Docker, deployed to AWS ECS with automated CI/CD pipelines, and implemented infrastructure as code using Terraform.

**Performance Optimization**: I consistently deliver high-performance solutions, including 60% query performance improvement through indexing strategies and SQL optimization, and <5 minute data latency in real-time pipelines processing 100K+ records.

**Orchestration & Monitoring**: I have deep expertise in Apache Airflow, managing 50+ production DAGs with complex dependencies, dynamic task generation, and automated error recovery. My ETL logging framework tracks 200+ daily jobs with detailed performance metrics.

**Data Governance**: I established data lineage tracking, created data cataloging systems, implemented data reconciliation processes, and built comprehensive data profiling tools ensuring compliance and data quality.

## Technical Stack & Expertise

**Databases**: PostgreSQL, Snowflake, Neo4j, Oracle, SQL Server, Redshift, pgvector
**Programming**: Python (Expert), SQL (Expert), Cypher, Bash, PySpark
**ETL & Orchestration**: Apache Airflow, dbt, Custom Python frameworks, Pandas, SQLAlchemy
**Cloud & DevOps**: AWS (S3, ECS, RDS, Lambda), Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Jenkins
**Data Quality**: Great Expectations, Custom validation frameworks, Automated testing

## Measurable Business Impact

My work has delivered significant value to Pharmaceutical:

- **Reduced data latency** from 24 hours to <5 minutes for critical metrics
- **Decreased cloud costs** by 30% through architectural improvements
- **Achieved 99.5% data quality** across production datasets
- **Improved query performance** by 60% through optimization
- **Automated 80+ manual processes**, saving 100+ hours monthly
- **Reduced debugging time** by 50% through graph-based lineage

## Leadership & Mentorship

Beyond technical contributions, I have mentored 5+ junior data engineers, leading to 2 promotions. I created educational frameworks, conducted code reviews, and established best practices that elevated the entire team's capabilities.

## Why?

What differentiates me is my ability to bridge complex technical implementation with business value. I don't just build pipelines—I architect data platforms that enable organizations to make faster, better decisions. My experience spans the full data engineering lifecycle: requirements gathering, architecture design, implementation, testing, deployment, monitoring, and continuous optimization.

## Next Steps

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in enterprise data platforms, real-time ETL, and graph databases can contribute to the company's data infrastructure. My GitHub repositories demonstrate my technical capabilities and commitment to engineering excellence.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of joining your team and contributing to the company's data engineering success.

Sincerely,

Serkan Coskun
